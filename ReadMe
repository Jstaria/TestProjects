Welcome to my public Test Project Repo!!!

My name is Joseph Staria and From here I will be implementing any ideas I have during my free time!

My current list of Projects from most impressive/best portfolio pieces to still pretty good, just not my magnum opus

1. being the best

1. Clicker Slots (2023 Projects)
    - My first personal game, complete with data structures galore and beautifully and elegantly picked visuals, especially the particle systems

1.5. Puzzle Golf (2023 Projects) (School Project)
    - The first team-based game managed and led most design choices and was the lead programmer for it.
        - I programmed the ball collision detection, 
        - the power system, 
        - helped create how the levels should be designed (such as syntax and how to use Google Sheets), 
        - designed the FileIO Class (which is an earlier rendition of what is used in 'Clicker Slots'),
    - because I was the team lead, I catered to team needs when programming challenges came up
        

2. Path Finding (2023 Projects)
    - Uses an altered version of Djikstra's, a flow model if you will. I wish I could find the documentation that I got the idea to try this, but alas.

3. Hexagon Tiling (2023 Projects)
    - Uses the projection collision learned in 'Test Collision' further down the list to create a board of hexagon tiles. It also has a simple rainbow shader made with HLSL

4. After Image (2023 Projects)
    - The first smooth player controller that also uses projection collision learned from 'Test Collision' to simulate attacking
    - Learned how to use double button presses

5. Test Collision (2023 Projects)
    - After many attempts trying to find the perfect collision detection (well as perfect as I could code with less than a year in C#), I found it with a tutorial in projection collision
    - I first tried to implement what I was seeing in my math class using line-on-line intersection to rap an n-gon in lines and then determine if it was colliding with something. 
    - That was both expensive and bad because if you were in the center of an object, it would register

6. Shadow (2023 Projects)
    - Shadows based on vector math, first use of camera transform matrices

7. Scare (2023 Projects)
    - Unfinished horror project that I wanted to use Dijkstra's for which then spawned Pathfinding in an effort to replicate it in a manner that wasn't going to lag any computer
    - Since I had a large board I wanted a large Dijkstra's area, but that's a pretty needy calculation
    - Shows the use of camera transforms and rotation of the flashlight

Other Projects That weren't mentioned are still good, but they are more foundation-building than show-off work

Oh also, if you want a cool screen saver I made in my first month or two at RIT, you should look at 2022 Projects, there is only one item
