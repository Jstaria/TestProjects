- The first team-based game managed and led most design choices and was the lead programmer for it.
- I programmed the ball collision detection and the power system, 
- Helped create how the levels should be designed (such as syntax and how to use Google Sheets)
- Designed the FileIO Class (which is an earlier rendition of what is used in 'Clicker Slots')
