Welcome to my public Test Project Repo!!!

My name is Joseph Staria and From here I will be implementing any ideas I have during my free time!

My current list of Projects from most impressive/best portfolio pieces to still pretty good, just not my magnum opus



## Crypt Keeper (2024 Projects/C++ SFML)

    - Using SFML built a 2D platformer from scratchS
    - Uses a custom built level creator which includes tiles, hitboxes, camera boundboxes
    - Started a light system, mesh for lights built with world collision

## Marching Cubes (2024 Projects)

![MarchingCubeAlgo](https://i.imgur.com/CQ7iPDX.png)

    - Using a 3D array of points, I can create 3D meshes using basic geometry
        - Mapping out all normals
        - Creating all triangles based on a triangulation table
        - Basic 3D and camera implementation using MonoGame Framework

## Marching Squares (2024 Projects)

    - Using a 2D array of points from noise, I was able to create basic geometry both interpolated and not.
        - I went on to use this implementation in Unity to create meshes from the data

## Wave Function Collapse - After (2024 Projects)

![WFCAlgo](https://i.imgur.com/F2TGVsV.png)

    - My implementation of collapsing cells in a 2D array with rules for tiles
    - Creates a very mesmerizing pattern if I do say so myself

## Clicker Slots (2023 Projects)

    - My first personal game, complete with data structures galore and beautifully and elegantly picked visuals, especially the particle systems

## Puzzle Golf (2023 Projects) (School Project)
    - The first team-based game managed and led most design choices and was the lead programmer for it.
        - I programmed the ball collision detection, 
        - the power system, 
        - helped create how the levels should be designed (such as syntax and how to use Google Sheets), 
        - designed the FileIO Class (which is an earlier rendition of what is used in 'Clicker Slots'),
    - because I was the team lead, I catered to team needs when programming challenges came up

## Path Finding (2023 Projects)

![SimplePathFinding](https://i.imgur.com/AOHPeWZ.png)

    - Uses an altered version of Djikstra's, a flow model if you will. I wish I could find the documentation that I got the idea to try this, but alas.

## Hexagon Tiling (2023 Projects)

![SATCollision](https://i.imgur.com/bbAHRQC.png)

    - Uses the projection collision learned in 'Test Collision' further down the list to create a board of hexagon tiles. It also has a simple rainbow shader made with HLSL

Other Projects That weren't mentioned are still good, but they are more foundation-building than show-off work

Oh also, if you want a cool screen saver I made in my first month or two at RIT, you should look at 2022 Projects, there is only one item
